<h2 id="context-and-organization">Context and organization</h2>

<p>The DGA has entrusted Inria, on behalf of all the partners of the PEC research centre (Pôle d’excellence cyber), with the organisation of “thematic semesters” dedicated to cybersecurity.</p>

<p>Led by one or several researchers from PEC partners, a thematic semester has the following objectives:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to strengthen the visibility and scientific activity of teams working on a given cybersecurity subject;</li>
  <li>to strengthen technology transfer activity through the development of platforms or proofs of concept;</li>
  <li>to carry out a strategic reflection on the theme, which will take the form of a white book intended to be widely disseminated and which will be used to steer funding by the PEC;</li>
  <li>to provide scientific formation and information for students and for the general public.</li>
</ul>

<p>To this end, a thematic semester is made up of a series of scientific events such as colloquia, conferences and working group meetings. There is a with thematic coherence between these events that are organized over a period of 3 to 6 months. These activities are complemented by short or longer term invitations of researchers and other events that may be organized in cooperation with the Rennes ecosystem.</p>
